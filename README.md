# What is skype-icons-improver?
  As we know 'Skype for linux' - the coolest piece of ~~shi~~ code that based on electron and pack most of their resources into asar packages.
  So, we can not change tray icons without unpacking packages. skype-icons-improver can solve this problem.
## Little dependencies...
  **nodejs**...

In the future I will try to get rid of nodejs.
